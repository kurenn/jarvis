### PostgreSQL tables, with their properties:
#
# buyers(id, name, sex, created_at)
# categories(id, name)
# orders(id, buyer_id, total, created_at)
# products(id, name, price, category_id)
# shipments(id, order_id, product_id)
#
### Follow the next instructions:
# 1. Add an alias for each column name prefixing it with the table's name
# 2. When displaying the category_id use the category name instead
# 3. When a date string is present, please cast them to database safe dates
# 4. While casting a date, if no year is provided, use the current year
# 5. When a string date does not include a year, append the current year to the date, and return that date
