# Rails + Docker + VSCode

The intention of this repository is to provide a fully functional template for new Rails applications which uses Docker for development with the advantage that if you are using VSCode, get all that configuration as well.

### Features

* The template uses Rails 7.0, but can be easily change to another version.
* Integrates TailwindCSS
* Integrates with DevContainers from VSCode, which allows you to debug and run the application from within the editor
* Provides extension suggestions for a better development experience
* Uses postgres as the Database
* For the test suite, it integrates RSpec, Capybara and Cuprite

Use this template as you like and enjoy!
